b)How to ensure that ANY machine learning technology is providing accurate results:
    1. High-Quality and Representative Data
    2. Regular Model Evaluation and Updating

c)
i) “Collect a small set of examples, train a system, test to see how good it is. Add more examples, train again, and then test again. Repeat until it gets good enough.”
Explaination
This method enables constant process improvement due to performance feedback allowing for efficient use of resources and early detection of errors. It aids in avoiding overfitting as the model gradually learns to generalize well with different inputs. This approach is more balanced and effective strategy for building machine learning models, as its adaptability covers a range of difficulty levels with tasks.
d) Other things could be analyzed using machine learning:
    1. Image
    2. speach
    3. Healthcare Diagnostics
    4. Biomedical Data
    5. User behavior
